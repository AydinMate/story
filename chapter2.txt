Olive and Ty, the two cheeky dogs, meet for the first time in the park. They sniff each other curiously and soon realize they have a lot in common. They both love to chase after butterflies and squirrels, and they both love to dig in the dirt. As they play together, their owners watch with smiles on their faces, happy to see their dogs having so much fun. Olive and Ty quickly become fast friends and spend many afternoons in the park together, exploring and having adventures.
