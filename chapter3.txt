Olive and Ty's bond continues to grow as they spend more and more time together. They develop a special routine of playing in the park, exploring new areas and sniffing around together. They also enjoy each other's company at home, taking naps and cuddling together.
Their owners also notice that they have become inseparable, they always look for each other when they are at the park, and they seem to communicate with each other in their own way.
One day, while they were out on a walk, Olive and Ty got lost. Their owners searched for them frantically, but they couldn't find them. After hours of searching, Olive and Ty finally found their way back home, tired but safe. From that moment on, the two dogs became even more protective of each other and their friendship became unbreakable.
